Hi! 👋🏻 

I'm Billy! Thanks for vising my site. A little about me...

I'm a:
- Father 🦸🏻‍♂️
- Husband 🧏🏻‍♂️
- Latter-day Saint 🙏🏻
- Developer 👨🏻‍💻
- Analyst 📊
- Tech Enthusiast 💻
- Amateur Handyman 🛠️

Currently I'm working remotely as an analytics developer working with JavaScript, but I've worked as a web developer in the past. Most of my work nowaday's is done using Adobe Launch, which I have a love/hate relationship with (mostly love though). I love the diverse challenges that analytics development involves and the opportunity to work with a wide range of internal and external IT and Marketing partners. You may think it's weird, but it's a lot of fun!

My wife and I welcomed our first baby, a little girl, in 2020, so needless to say that has kept us busy. We also have two dogs (in case we didn't have enough to take care of). We're very active in our church and have held various leadership and teaching positions (again, as if we didn't have enough to do). My family and faith are my top priority, and I think this makes me better in all other aspects of life.

I'm also an insatiable learner, constantly trying to learn new things. I've tried my hand at guitar, woodworking, FOREX trading, app development, and a host of other topics. But this year, the topics I want to focus on are fitness and writing. 

Working from home permanently, most of which takes place sitting in front of a computer, has made me realize how important exercise and diet are to my health. Also, thanks again to remote work, I've been able to gain a couple extra hours a day that I used to spend driving. My goal is to channel that extra time into improving and practicing my writing. Some of that will translate to posts that I share on this site (so be sure to check back and see what's new). I also want to try my hand at some more creative forms of writing, so we'll see how that goes. 

I'd love to connect to anyone who shares any common interests, works in a similar (or not so similar) industry, or has any suggestions of new topics, tech, books, etc. that I should check out. Also, feel free to critique me wherever you see fit. As I said before, I'm always trying to learn and improve and I believe constructive criticism is a helpful tool to accomplish that. 

Anyways, that's enough about me for now. If you'd like to read more about what prompted me to start sharing on this blog click [here](/hello-world/). I hope you find something enjoyable!
