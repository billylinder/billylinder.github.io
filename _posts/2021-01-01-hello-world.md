Hello! I'm Billy Linder, and this is my new site. I've been wanting to update it for a while and get back into writing, so I figured what better time to start than the new year! I know it's cliche at this point, but 2020 was crazy for a lot of reasons.

## In case you forgot

### 1. Toilet paper disappeared...

## Onward and Upward

Now, with a new addition to the family, a new remote job, and a world that just keeps trying to find a way to kill us, I feel like I need an outlet and a way to stay sane. I plan on writing something at least twice a month, sometimes more, sometimes less. If we've learned anything this past year it's that nobody knows what curveballs will come our way. 

The topics are going to be varied, so if you don't care about every aspect of my life (and why would you) just go to [Categories](/categories/) to filter by whatever you're interested in at the moment. I'll write about life, work, faith, or anything else that I'm thinking about, so hopefully you'll find something that's valuable to you.
